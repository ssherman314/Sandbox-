# To setup the virtual environment (contain pip dependencies):

```python3 -m venv ./venv```

```source ./venv/bin/activate```

```pip3 install -r requirements.txt\```

## After that, if you want to download all the GTeX datasets into the .venv, run ./setup.sh

**WARNING**: this downloads everything! (it will probably take a while)

If you prefer, run sections individually if you know what you want.
